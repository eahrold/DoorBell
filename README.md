This is an objective-c port-knocking front end for IceFloor http://www.hanynet.com/icefloor/
It enhances the port-knocker that comes bundled with IceFloor by keeping a list of the servers
you've connected to in the past and storing the ports of the knock sequence in the users keychain.

For 10.8 and up...
